## Information
textadv is a basic text-based roguelike dungeon crawler game. It is called "textadv" because I suck at naming things.

This game is purely a passion project, and its main purpose is to give me something to do while bored in class. It is also 
my attempt at learning how to use different tools such as GitHub for a more efficient and professional workflow, as well as an 
introduction to a basic game design and development process.

## How to Play
Downloading and playing textadv is very easy.

1. Navigate to the desired [release version](https://github.com/akirs3106/textadv/releases)
2. Download the corresponding "textadv-vX.X.X.zip" folder
3. Extract the zip folder
4. Run the .exe file found in the extracted folder

> [!NOTE]
> The release packages do not require the user to have a specific version of Java downloaded, as the runtime is included with the package.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently this only works on the Windows OS, as it utilizes the Windows console.
> I may or may not develop separate versions for different OS platforms in the future.
